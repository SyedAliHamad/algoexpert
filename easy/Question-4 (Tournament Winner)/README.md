# Tournamnet Winner

We are given an 2d array with mathces played between different parties in a tournamnet. We have another Array of results which gives us the result of thse matches.
We need to Print out the team which won the tournement.

## Example

'Competitions = [["HTML","c#"],
                ["c#","Python"],
                ["Python","HTML"]]'

Results = [0,0,1]

For match 1 = 'HTML' VS 'C#' Result is 0 means 2nd element (c#) Won this one
For match 2 = 'C#' VS 'python' Result is 0 means 2nd element (Python) won
For match 3 = 'python' vs 'HTML' Result is 1 means 1st element (Python) Won

Since Python won most matches Python is the Winner of the tournament
