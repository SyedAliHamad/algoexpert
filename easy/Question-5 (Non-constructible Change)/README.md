# Non-Contructible Change

We are given an array and the array contains a positive non-zero integers represnting the value of coins in our possesion. We can have multiple coins of the same value so coins are not unique.

We have to look at the coins and find the minimum amount of change we can not create.

## Example: 
Given array of Coins [ 1, 2, 5 ]

We can create change of 1 from 1

we can create change of 2 from 2

we can create change of 3 from 1 + 2

we can't create change of 4 

So minumum amount of change we can't calculate with this will be 4.
